# We Know What You Did Last Summer!

Wildlife attacks happen much more frequently than we would like to think about. They can range from a simple bee sting to being mauled by a cougar. According to an article from Forbes.com, Texas ranked as the number one in wildlife deaths. We wanted to review the information presented and see if these results matched up. 

# CDC Data

We began by visiting the same data generated for this article, by going to the CDC’s website. Here we were able to use their database and break down an initial set of data for us to use. We then took that to help recreate similar results that would give us deaths by state and rank them in order of deaths by wildlife attack. Some limitations of the CDC data are that we are unable to know specifically what species of animal attack led to a fatality and there were some numbers that were “Suppressed” for confidentiality reasons. Given more time we could expand the data to include the type of data attacks. As for the suppressed values we gave them a zero as a place holder. Now give this we had our results:

Our results using the database agree with the article that began our idea. Texas is the leading state for deaths suffered from wildlife. Now this data is only from the years 2007 to 2018, where as the original article reviews from 1999 to 2020. The reasoning we changed the time was to match the time frame of our next data.

# Park Data

We still needed a second set of data to merge this set with. We then had the idea to measure the deaths of wildlife attacks, with deaths that occur in National Parks. We found a table from another article online. This time showing the deaths were recorded in state parks from the years 2008 to 2017. We did add an extra line from the article to show what state each park was located in. After adding this data, we broke it down to match the results of the previous established set. We set out to show the total of deaths occurring at each state park and then but them in descending order. Upon this we show the following:

The most deaths occurred at Lake Mead National Recreation Area located in Nevada. There are a few states that do not have any recorded deaths in state parks from 2008 to 2017, a few states have no reported data. This also shows deaths that were unrelated to wildlife attacks. We now have abase to combine the data though and in it we will see where in the United States, may be a detriment to your well-being
